        <p>Everything started in this game, in this place.
            When we first met, we were strangers who couldn’t even communicate, because we didn’t speak the same
            language.
            But despite that, we kept playing together every day, getting to know each other little by little.
            Even though we barely talked, we always tried to enjoy our time together, and slowly, our love began to
            grow.
            What started as a simple game became something real</p>

        <p>One day we got lost in Minecraft, and it was my fault. I told you we should go exploring by boat, and night
            fell, and we had no idea where we were. You were angry, but I couldn't stop laughing; I couldn't believe
            what I'd done. The good thing is that we finally found the house, but I died like twice :,,) </p>

        <p>When we played, we always did the same thing. We'd kill this boss and play with the stones. It was like a
            ritual because we always did it whenever we saw each other, even though it was simple stuff, we always
            enjoyed it.</p>
